Description:
  'Measurements of the production of jets of particles in association with a $Z$
   boson in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 7 TeV are presented, using data corresponding
   to an integrated luminosity of 4.6/fb collected by the ATLAS experiment at
   the Large Hadron Collider. Inclusive and differential jet cross sections in $Z$
   events, with Z decaying into electron or muon pairs, are measured for jets with
   transverse momentum $p_T > 30$ GeV and rapidity $|y| < 4.4$.

   This Rivet module implements the event selection for the weighted combination
   of both decay channels and uses the data from that combination (as in the
   paper plots). But for simplification of its usage it only requires events with
   the electronic final state (muonic final state will be ignored). This allows
   to use it with either pure electronic samples, or mixed electron/muon events.
   If you want to use it with a pure muon sample, please refer to
   ATLAS\_2013\_I1230812\_MU.'
